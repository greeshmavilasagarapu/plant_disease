# Plant Disease Detection

## About the Project

This project is about detecting plant diseases using leaf images. A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify whether a plant leaf is healthy or affected by a disease based on its visual features.

## What I Did

* Collected a plant leaf image dataset from Kaggle
* Used Google Colab to run and train the model
* Preprocessed the images
* Built and trained a CNN model
* Checked the model performance using accuracy and loss

## Tools Used

* Python
* Google Colab
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

## Dataset

The dataset was taken from Kaggle and contains images of plant leaves divided into different classes such as healthy and diseased. The images were loaded directly into Google Colab.

## How It Works

The model learns patterns from leaf images like color changes, spots, and texture. These learned features help the model decide whether the plant is healthy or diseased.

## Result

The model was able to classify plant leaf images with good accuracy, showing that CNNs can be useful for basic plant disease detection tasks.
